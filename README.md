# WatchSleepNet Reproducibility Project (CSE6250 - Fall 2025)

## Objective
Reproduce the results from *WatchSleepNet: A Novel Model and Pretraining Approach for Advancing Sleep Staging with Smartwatches* (Wang et al., CHIL 2025).

## Team
- Dawoud Mahmud
- [Teammate Name]

## Goals
- Reimplement the WatchSleepNet architecture (CNN + TCN + BiLSTM + Attention)
- Reproduce fine-tuning results on the DREAMT dataset
- Compare with baseline sleep staging models
- Evaluate transfer learning improvements

## Project Structure
